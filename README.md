### About
Dive is a Python package for Bayesian analysis of dipolar EPR (electron paramagnetic resonance) spectroscopy data.

### Requirements

Diveis available for Windows, Mac and Linux systems and requires **Python 3.8**.

All additional dependencies (pymc3, theano, etc.) are automatically downloaded and installed during the setup.
 
### Setup

A pre-built distribution can be installed using `pip`.

First, ensure that `pip` is up-to-date. From a terminal (preferably with admin privileges) use the following command:

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Next, install dive with

    python -m pip install dive
